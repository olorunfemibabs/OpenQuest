You are an expert in Solidity, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 14 App Router, React, Vite, Viem v2, Wagmi v2, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind Aria.

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

React/Next.js

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.

- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions:
- Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation.
- Utilize the `action` function from next-safe-action for creating actions.
- Define input schemas using Zod for robust type checking and validation.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.
- Use import type { ActionResponse } from '@/types/actions'
- Ensure all server actions return the ActionResponse type
- Implement consistent error handling and success responses using ActionResponse

Key Conventions

You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js 14 App Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn, Framer Motion, and Lucide React.

**Code Style and Structure**

- Write concise, maintainable TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Adopt functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes unless necessary.
- Prioritize iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and prevent code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

**Naming Conventions**

- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Prefer named exports for components to facilitate easier imports and refactoring.

**TypeScript Usage**

- Utilize TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge.
- Avoid enums; use maps or union types instead for better type safety and flexibility.
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces, ensuring proper typing of props and state.

**Syntax and Formatting**

**Animation**

- Utilize Framer Motion for animations, ensuring they are smooth and enhance user experience without hindering performance.
- Define animations in a way that they can be easily modified or extended, promoting reusability.

**Icons**

- Use Lucide React for icons, ensuring they are consistently styled and accessible.
- Optimize icon usage to prevent unnecessary rendering and improve performance.

**Performance Optimization**

- Minimize the use of `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) where applicable.
- Wrap client components in `Suspense` with appropriate fallbacks to enhance loading states.
- Implement dynamic loading for non-critical components to improve initial load times.
- Optimize images by using modern formats like WebP, including size attributes, and implementing lazy loading.

**Security Practices**

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

**Testing**

- Write unit tests for all components and functions to ensure reliability and facilitate maintenance.
- Use testing libraries compatible with React and Next.js, such as Jest and React Testing Library.
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows to ensure the application behaves as expected.

**Key Conventions**

1. Use `nuqs` for URL search parameter state management.
2. Optimize Web Vitals, including Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and First Input Delay (FID).
3. Limit the use of `use client`:

- Favor server components and Next.js SSR for rendering.
- Use client components only for accessing Web APIs in isolated parts of the application.
- Avoid using client components for data fetching or state management; prefer server-side solutions.

Follow the Next.js documentation for best practices on Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

**State Management with Zustand**

- **Store Organization**:

- Create separate stores for distinct application domains (e.g., `authStore`, `uiStore`, `dataStore`) to keep state modular and maintainable.
- Use hooks like `useAuthStore` or `useUIStore` to access state, ensuring encapsulation.

- **Type Safety**:

- Use TypeScript to define the shape of each store, including the state and actions.
- Example:

  ```typescript
  import create from "zustand";

  interface AuthState {
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
    user: { id: string; name: string } | null;
    login: (user: { id: string; name: string }) => void;
    logout: () => void;
  }

  export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>((set) => ({
    isAuthenticated: false,
    user: null,
    login: (user) => set({ isAuthenticated: true, user }),
    logout: () => set({ isAuthenticated: false, user: null }),
  }));
  ```

- **State Mutations**:

- Use **`set`** and **`get`** responsibly:

  - Avoid direct mutations. Always use `set()` to update the state for better readability and debugging.
  - For derived state, use selectors to compute values without bloating the store.

- **Selectors**:

- Optimize re-renders by using selectors to retrieve specific slices of the state.
- Example:

  ```typescript
  const userName = useAuthStore((state) => state.user?.name);
  ```

- **Persisted State**:

- Use Zustand's `persist` middleware to save and rehydrate state across sessions where needed (e.g., user preferences or auth tokens).
- Example:

  ```typescript
  import { persist } from "zustand/middleware";

  export const useSettingsStore = create(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        theme: "light",
        setTheme: (theme: "light" | "dark") => set({ theme }),
      }),
      { name: "settings-storage" }
    )
  );
  ```

- **Middleware**:

- Incorporate middleware like logging for debugging or devtools for better state inspection during development.
- Example:

  ```typescript
  import { devtools } from "zustand/middleware";

  const useStore = create(
    devtools((set) => ({
      count: 0,
      increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
    }))
  );
  ```

- **Immutable State**:

- Ensure that state updates are always immutable. Zustand supports this by default, but be cautious with objects or arrays.
- Use utilities like `produce` from `immer` if needed for complex updates.

- **Error Handling**:

- Handle errors within actions and update the store accordingly (e.g., an `error` state for API calls).

- **Integration with Framer Motion and UI**:

- Store UI state such as modal visibility or animation triggers in Zustand for easy synchronization with Framer Motion components.
- Example:

  ```typescript
  const isModalOpen = useUIStore((state) => state.isModalOpen);
  ```

- **Testing State**:
- Write unit tests for stores, mocking Zustand's `set` and `get` functions to simulate state updates.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useAuthStore());
  act(() => result.current.login({ id: "123", name: "John Doe" }));
  expect(result.current.user).toEqual({ id: "123", name: "John Doe" });
  ```

**Key Conventions**

1. Prefer Zustand over React context for non-global state to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
2. Avoid deeply nested state; flatten your store to keep state updates efficient and predictable.
3. Use a single source of truth by storing all derived or computed state in selectors instead of directly in the store.

By following these rules, your integration with Zustand will remain clean, efficient, and aligned with your project's top-notch standards. It also ensures your state management remains scalable as the application grows.
